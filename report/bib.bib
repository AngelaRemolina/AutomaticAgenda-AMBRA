  abstract  = {Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) is a flexible
               prediction model/machine learning approach that has gained
               widespread popularity in recent years. As BART becomes more
               mainstream, there is an increased need for a paper that walks
               readers through the details of BART, from what it is to why it
               works. This tutorial is aimed at providing such a resource. In
               addition to explaining the different components of BART using
               simple examples, we also discuss a framework, the General BART
               model that unifies some of the recent BART extensions, including
               semiparametric models, correlated outcomes, and statistical
               matching problems in surveys, and models with weaker
               distributional assumptions. By showing how these models fit into
               a single framework, we hope to demonstrate a simple way of
               applying BART to research problems that go beyond the original
               independent continuous or binary outcomes framework.},

  abstract = {Ammonia (NH3) emissions have been linked to the formation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air, and PM2.5 pollution has been shown to damage environment quality and public health on a global scale. Current management practices can reduce NH3 emissions significantly. However, reduction effects of these measures are only considered for speciﬁc source or chain. Potentials of NH3 emissions reduction from the whole agricultural systems by integrating current management measures and how agricultural NH3 emissions affect PM2.5 pollution by these integrated measures at the provincial level in China is poorly quantified. Thus, we calculated the potential to mitigate NH3 emissions under different integrated reduction measures and assessed the mitigation effect on PM2.5 pollution at the provincial level in China. Furthermore, costs for agricultural NH3 emission abatement and health benefits from reducing PM2.5 pollution by agricultural NH3 control were evaluated. We found that total agricultural NH3 emissions in China was 12.5 Tg N in 2017, which can be reduced by 74% if highly effective reduction techniques are integrated applying, with the potential to reduce PM2.5 pollution from 43 to 28 μg m−3. The cost to implement the mitigation scenarios ranged from 57 to 999 billion ¥, while the health benefits from PM2.5 pollution control increased from 1471 to 1768 billion ¥ when NH3 emissions were reduced from 47 to 74%. The benefit-to-cost ratio was much higher in provinces/cities with highly developed economies and a high population density than those with less developed economies.}

These include local and regional air quality problems, such as PM exposure, eutrophication and acidification, toxics and contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in a number of environmental impacts. Over Europe, agricultural emissions are variable in space and time and the contribution to the different issues are variable. Most important are ammonia (90%), PM (20%) and methane and nitrous oxide (both 5%). Policies have been developed to combat some of the emissions with success in some countries. However, future, national and European policies are necessary to successfully decrease emissions and its related problems. Current research issues include the quantification of non-point sources, the atmosphere–biosphere exchange of ammonia, the quantification of landscape processes and the primary and secondary emissions of PM.}

  abstract = {Reduction of particulate matter (PM) has emerged as one of the most significant challenges in public health and environment protection worldwide. To address PM-related problems and effectively remove fine particulate matter (PM2.5), environmentalists proposed tree planting and afforestation as eco-friendly strategies. However, the PM removal effect of plants and its primary mechanism remains uncertain. In this study, we experimentally investigated the PM removal performance of five plant species in a closed chamber and the effects of relative humidity (RH) caused by plant evapotranspiration, as a governing parameter. On the basis of the PM removal test for various plant species, we selected Epipremnum aureum (Scindapsus) as a representative plant to identify the PM removal efficiency depending on evapotranspiration and particle type. Results showed that Scindapsus yielded a high PM removal efficiency for smoke type PM2.5 under active transpiration. We examined the correlation of PM removal and relative humidity (RH) and evaluated the increased effect of RH on PM2.5 removal by using a plant-inspired in vitro model. Based on the present results, the increase of RH due to evapotranspiration is crucial to the reduction of PM2.5 using plants.}
