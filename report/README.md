# Greetings and thank You for reading me!

The file "first_review.tex" is the first review presentation file that was previously called "main.tex".

The file "final_report.tex" is, you guessed it, the final report document.

I chose [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/article-format-thesis-scuola-di-ingegneria-industriale-e-dellinformazione-politecnico-di-milano/vtqgsrqwzdmy] as a template because it looked cool and slightly set it up for our purpose. If you have better looking alternatives, please let it be known.

Please put your personal documentation in the "Partial Documentation" folder and give it a meaningful name.
